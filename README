Bikkhon
=======

*Bikkhon*, meaning "find" or "locate" in Bengali, is a supplementary project to [Kolorob](https://www.facebook.com/scib.kolorob/), an app under development to help slum dwellers in Mirpur, Dhaka search and navigate to services in their area.

Bikkhon is designed to be a test harness for different routing services, such as [Google Maps Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) and [GraphHopper](https://graphhopper.com/), based on [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) data. It uses the [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/) library for rendering different routes suggested by these services.
